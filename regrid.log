     Program MTXCALC to produce a sparse grid-to-grid transform
     matrix for specified input and output grids, and write the
     result to a sparse-matrix file.  The algorithm employed is
     to sub-sample each input cell using a subsampled grid of size
     COL_REFINEMENT by ROW_REFINEMENT in each input grid cell,
     where COL_REFINEMENT and ROW_REFINEMENT are environment
     variables set by the user (with defaults to a 100 by 100
     refinement, in case they are not set).
      
     Usage:  MTXCALC [INGRID OUTGRID] <and follow the prompts>
      
     where <INGRID> and <OUTGRID> are the GRIDDESC names of the
     input and output grids for the transformation.  If these are
     not entered at the command line, the program will prompt you
     for them.
      
     PRECONDITIONS REQUIRED:
      
         setenv COL_REFINEMENT col-sampling factor (default 100)
         setenv ROW_REFINEMENT row-sampling factor (default 100)
         setenv GRIDDESC   <path name for grid descriptions file>
         setenv MATRIX        <path name for I/O API matrix file>
         setenv MATTXT        <path name for  ASCII  matrix file,
                              or "NONE" to suppress ASCII output>
      
     The following input and output coordinate systems are
     supported:
         Latitude-Longitude    
         Lambert Conformal Conic
         UTM

     Missing environment variable EXECUTION_ID
      
     Program MTXCPLE to read a sparse (grid-to-grid transform)
     matrix, and then all variables in each time step in the
     specified time step sequence from the specified input
     file, optionally under the control of the specified
     synchronization file, copy or interpolate them to the 
     output grid, and write them to the specified output file.
      
     THE PROGRAM WILL PROMPT YOU for the logical names of the
     input matrix file, the input data file, the input synch file
     the GRIDDESC name of the output grid, the output file, the
     time step sequence.
     Default responses are indicated in square brackets
     [LIKE THIS], and may be accepted by hitting the RETURN key.
      
     PRECONDITIONS REQUIRED:
      
         setenv <input matrix file>    <path-name>
         setenv <input data   file>    <path-name>
         setenv <input synch  file>    <path-name, or "NONE">
         setenv GRIDDESC               <path-name> (if interp)
         time step sequence is valid for both input files
         For interpolation, file type must be GRIDDED, and either
         the input and output coordinate system types must be the
         same, or must be selected from one of the following
         supported coordinate conversions:
             Lambert  to/from  Lambert (w/ different parameters),
             Lambert  to/from  Lat-Lon,
             Lambert  to/from  UTM,
             Lat-Lon  to/from  Polar Stereographic,
             Lat-Lon  to/from  Transverse Mercator,
             Lat-Lon  to/from  Equatorial Mercator,
         For interpolation, the output grid should have a finer
         resolution than the input grid (else you should use an
         aggregation program instead of an input program).
         For copy, file type must be GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, or CUSTOM.
